Music Key Generator is used to help 'rote' learn musical keys by getting yourself used to the muscle memory of the note positions. You can specify a timed interval to be given the keys, or just manually press the button to be given one.

Future implementations & Known Issues

- GUI Threading - currently hangs when playing audio clip
- No sharp keys
- Audio clip for 'minor' is a terrible self recording and I'll replace it eventually
- Adjustable time period for interval
